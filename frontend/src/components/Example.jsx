                                This is one common one as you can locate these emails on your spam folders of your inboxes
                                as they make look like legitimate but by clicking on the link there shown will make the user go to a certain website  Using the same phrasing, typefaces, logos, and signatures makes the messages appear legitimate.

                                In addition, attackers will usually try to push users into action by creating a sense of urgency. For example here in the picture it says that you are one of the chosen to have an iPhone 14 pro for free even if you haven't done anything to get it sounds too good to be true isn't it ? Actually it is because itâ€™s a type of scam that people will bite on.
